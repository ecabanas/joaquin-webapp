# Future Developments

This document tracks planned features, ideas, and improvements for the Joaquin application.

## Planned Features

- **Push Notifications:** Implement push notifications for key events (e.g., when a partner adds an item to the list).
- **User Invitations:** Fully implement the user invitation flow from the Settings page to allow users to add members to their workspace.
- **Profile Photo Upload:** Allow users to upload a custom profile photo instead of using the generated avatar.
- **Barcode Scanning:** Add the ability to scan item barcodes to quickly add them to the list.
- **Enhanced Analytics:**
    - Add more filters to the analytics dashboard (e.g., by user).
    - Create a "deal finder" that highlights when an item's price is lower than its historical average.

## Ideas & Mockups

- **Meal Planning:** A dedicated section for planning weekly meals and automatically generating a grocery list from that plan.
- **Recipe Integration:** Allow users to save recipes and add all ingredients to the list with a single click.
